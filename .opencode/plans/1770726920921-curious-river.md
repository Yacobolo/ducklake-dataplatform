# Consolidate Duplicated Migration Files

## Problem
`catalog/migrations/` and `db/migrations/` contain identical SQL migration files. Two different tools read them:
- **sqlc** reads `db/migrations/` at code-gen time (configured in `sqlc.yaml`)
- **goose** reads `catalog/migrations/` at runtime (embedded via `//go:embed` in `catalog/migrate.go`)

## Plan

### Step 1: Update `sqlc.yaml`
**File:** `sqlc.yaml` (line 4)

Change:
```yaml
schema: "db/migrations"
```
To:
```yaml
schema: "catalog/migrations"
```

### Step 2: Delete `db/migrations/`
Remove the entire `db/migrations/` directory (5 files):
- `001_create_principals.sql`
- `002_create_groups.sql`
- `003_create_privilege_grants.sql`
- `004_create_row_filters.sql`
- `005_create_column_masks.sql`

### Step 3: Verify sqlc still generates correctly
Run `sqlc generate` and confirm the output in `db/catalog/` is unchanged.

### Step 4: Verify the app builds and tests pass
Run `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` to confirm nothing is broken.

## Files Modified
- `sqlc.yaml` — change schema path
- `db/migrations/*` — delete all 5 files

## Verification
1. `sqlc generate` succeeds
2. `git diff db/catalog/` shows no changes to generated code
3. `go build ./...` succeeds
4. `go test ./...` passes
