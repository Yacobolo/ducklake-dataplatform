# Plan: Create `/implement` Custom Command

## Goal

Create an OpenCode custom slash command `/implement` that reads the current plan and outputs a step-by-step guide of commands to run — without executing anything. The agent derives a fitting branch name from the plan content.

## Files to Create

### `.opencode/commands/implement.md`

A markdown command file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Generate implementation steps from the current plan
---
```

No `agent` override — uses the current agent. No arguments needed.

### Template body

The prompt instructs the agent to:

1. Read the most recent plan file (injected via `!`cat $(ls -t .opencode/plans/*.md | head -1)``)
2. Derive a descriptive branch name from the plan content using conventions: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/` prefix + kebab-case summary
3. Output a numbered step-by-step list of commands to copy-paste, covering:
   - `git worktree add ../duck-demo-worktrees/<branch-name> -b <branch-name>`
   - `cd ../duck-demo-worktrees/<branch-name>`
   - Any setup commands (e.g. `task build` to verify the worktree works)
   - Implementation guidance (which files to edit, in what order)
   - `git add . && git commit -m "<conventional commit message>"`
   - `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
   - Cleanup: `git worktree remove ../duck-demo-worktrees/<branch-name>`
4. Do NOT execute any commands — only print them
5. Include best practices for branch naming and commit messages inline

## Verification

1. Confirm file exists: `ls .opencode/commands/implement.md`
2. In OpenCode TUI, type `/` and verify `implement` appears with description
3. Run `/implement` — agent should read the latest plan and output steps without running anything
